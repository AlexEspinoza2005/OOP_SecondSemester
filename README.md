# OOP Second Semester

Welcome to the OOP Second Semester project! This repository contains a collection of Java programs focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It serves as a practical resource for learning and understanding OOP principles and their applications.

## Description

This repository serves as a learning resource for Object-Oriented Programming, providing various Java implementations that illustrate key OOP concepts. Each program demonstrates different features of OOP, including:

- Abstraction: Implementing abstract classes and interfaces.
- Encapsulation: Using access modifiers to protect data.
- Inheritance: Creating subclasses and demonstrating inheritance relationships.
- Polymorphism: Utilizing method overriding and overloading.

Explore the provided examples to deepen your understanding of OOP principles!
